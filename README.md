# scikit-batch-rl
Data-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning library in scikit-learn style.

```py
from skbrl.dataset import MDPDataset
from skbrl.algos import BEAR

# MDPDataset takes arrays of state transitions
dataset = MDPDataset(observations, actions, rewards, terminals)

# train data-driven deep RL
bear = BEAR()
bear.fit(dataset.episodes)

# ready to control
actions = bear.predict(x)
```

These are the design principles of scikit-batch-rl:
- This library is designed for practical projects unlike the many other RL libraries.
- This library is not focusing on reproducing RL papers.
- This library is adding more techniques than the original implementations.

## scikit-learn compatibility
This library is designed as if born from scikit-learn.
You can fully utilize scikit-learn's utilities to increase your productivity.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from skbrl.metrics.scorer import td_error_scorer

train_episodes, test_episodes = train_test_split(dataset)

bear.fit(train_episodes,
         eval_episodes=test_episodes,
         scorers={'td_error': td_error_scorer})
```

You can naturally perform cross-validation.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate

scores = cross_validate(bear, dataset, scoring={'td_error': td_error_scorer})
```

And more.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

gscv = GridSearchCV(estimator=bear,
                    param_grid={'actor_learning_rate': np.arange(1, 10) * 1e-3},
                    scoring={'td_error': td_error_scorer},
                    refit=False)
gscv.fit(train_episodes)
```

## deploy
Machine learning models often require dependencies even after deployment.
scikit-batch-rl provides more flexible options to solve this problem via torch
script so that the production environment never cares about which algorithms
and hyperparameters are used to train.

```py
# save the learned greedy policy as torch script
bear.save_policy('policy.pt')

# load the policy without any dependencies except pytorch
policy = torch.jit.load('policy.pt')
actions = policy(x)
```

even on C++
```c++
torch::jit::script::Module module;
try {
  module = torch::jit::load('policy.pt');
} catch (const c10::Error& e) {
  //
}
```

## supported algorithms

- [ ] random network augmentation

## supported evaluation metrics
scikit-learn style scoring functions are provided.
```py
from skrbl.metrics.scorer import td_error_scorer

train_episodes, test_episodes = train_test_split(dataset)

bear.fit(train_episodes,
         eval_episodes=test_episodes,
         scorers={'td_error': td_error_scorer})
```

If you have an access to the target environments, you can also evaluate
algorithms on them.
```py
from skbrl.metics.scorer import evaluate_on_environment

env_scorer = evaluate_on_environment(gym.make('Pendulum-v0'))

bear.fit(train_episodes,
         eval_episodes=test_episodes,
         scorers={'td_error': td_error_scorer,
                  'environment': env_scorer})
```

- [ ] Off-policy Classification (requires success flags)
- [x] Temporal-difference Error
- [x] Discounted Sum of Advantages
- [x] Average value estimation
- [x] Evaluation with gym-like environments

## contributions
### coding style
This library is fully formatted with [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf).
You can format the entire scripts as follows:
```
$ ./scripts/format
```

### test
The unit tests are provided as much as possible.
You can run the entire tests as follows:
```
$ ./scripts/test
```

If you give `-p` option, the performance tests with toy tasks are also run
(this will take minutes).
```
$ ./scripts/test -p
```
